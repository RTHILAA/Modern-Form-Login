## Features :

- **Responsive Design**: The form is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile and desktop.
- **Interactive Input Fields**: Animated labels that move when the input field is focused or filled.
- **Blurred Background**: A visually appealing blurred background effect using `backdrop-filter`.
- **Custom Checkbox**: A custom-styled "Remember Me" checkbox with hover and checked states.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Smooth hover and focus transitions for buttons and input fields.

## Technologies Used :

- **HTML5**: For structuring the form and content.
- **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and responsive design.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons (user and lock icons).
- **Google Fonts**: Using "Poppins" font for a modern and clean typography style.

## How to Use :

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the login form.
3. Interact with the form to see the animations and hover effects.

## File Structure :

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the login form.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing all the styles, animations, and responsive design.
- `bg.jpg`: The background image used in the form (ensure this file is in the same directory as the HTML and CSS files).

## Customization :

- **Change Background Image**: Replace the `bg.jpg` file with your own image.
- **Update Text**: Modify the text in the `index.html` file to reflect your content.
- **Adjust Colors**: Change the color scheme by editing the `style.css` file.

## Key CSS Features :

- **Blurred Background**: Achieved using `backdrop-filter: blur(25px);` on the login form container.
- **Animated Labels**: Labels move above the input fields when focused or filled, using the `:focus` and `:valid` pseudo-classes.
- **Custom Checkbox**: A custom-styled checkbox using `appearance: none;` and pseudo-elements for the checkmark.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Smooth transitions for hover effects and input field interactions using `transition`.
